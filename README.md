#BitTheta Secure
#Description
BitTheta Secure is a decentralized platform for secure file, media, and message transfer. This platform combines zkSync for privacy-preserving transactions and Theta Network for decentralized storage and content delivery. The aim is to create a secure and efficient way for users to share and transfer data without exposing their IP addresses or other sensitive information. Uses wormhole and zkSNARK.

#Key Features
Privacy-Preserving Transactions: Utilize zkSync to ensure transactions are private and secure, preventing IP address exposure.
Decentralized Storage and Delivery: Leverage Theta EdgeCloud for efficient and decentralized content storage and delivery.
Encrypted Messaging: Implement secure messaging functionality to enable private communication.
Incentive Mechanism: Use TNT-20 tokens to reward users for sharing and storing data securely.
Technology Stack
Smart Contracts: Solidity
Backend: JavaScript
Frontend: JavaScript (React)
Privacy: zkSync
Storage and Delivery: Theta Network
#BitTheta Secure: Phase 1 and Beyond
